TEAM Data Processing Tools (R)
===============================================================================

Overview
_______________________________________________________________________________

The `teamr` package is designed to facilitate the work of the Tropical Ecology 
Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network.
The `TEAM Network <http://www.teamnetwork.org/>`_ is a global network of sites 
in tropical forests focused on collecting standardized real-time data measuring 
the response of tropical forests to changing climate, land cover and land use, 
and population.

The TEAM Data Processing Tools are a collection of scripts written in R and 
Python to facilitate the processing and analysis of TEAM data and remote 
sensing imagery of TEAM sites for measuring change in ecosystems from the 
plot-landscape scales.  This package includes the R scripts in the toolkit.  
The `teampy package
<https://github.com/azvoleff/teampy>`_ includes the Python scripts that are 
part of the toolkit. Both packages are required in order to use the toolkit.

The toolkit is still under active development. Follow the `TEAM website 
<http://www.teamnetwork.org/>`_ for news, and the `toolkit project page on 
github
<https://github.com/azvoleff/teamr>`_ for the latest version of the code.
