\title{GLCM textures calculated in EXELIS ENVI (for testing purposes)}
\description{
This is the output from running a "co-occurrence measures" calculation to 
calculate GLCM textures in EXELIS ENVI from the \code{test_raster} included 
in the \code{glcm} package. The following settings were used: window size 
5x7; co-occurrence shift 2 rows (y in ENVI), 3 columns (x in ENVI); 
greyscale textures to compute: mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, 
dissimilarity, entropy, second moment, correlation.
