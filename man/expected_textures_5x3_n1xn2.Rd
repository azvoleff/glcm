\title{GLCM textures calculated in EXELIS ENVI (for testing purposes)}
\description{
This is the output from running a "co-occurrence measures" calculation to
calculate GLCM textures in EXELIS ENVI from the \code{test_raster} included
in the \code{glcm} package. The following settings were used: window size
5x3; co-occurrence shift -1 row (y in ENVI), -2 columns (x in ENVI);
greyscale quantization levels 32; textures to compute: mean, variance,
homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment, correlation.
