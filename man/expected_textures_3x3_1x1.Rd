\title{GLCM textures calculated in EXELIS ENVI (for testing purposes)}
\description{
This is the output from running a "co-occurrence measures"
calculation to calculate GLCM textures in EXELIS ENVI from
the \code{test_raster} included in the \code{glcm} package.
The following settings were used: window size 3x3;
co-occurrence shift 1 (x), 1 (y); greyscale quantization
levels 32; textures to compute: mean, variance,
homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second
moment, correlation.
