# TEAM Data Processing Tools

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/azvoleff/teamr.png)](https://travis-ci.org/azvoleff/teamr)

## Overview

The `teamr` package is designed to facilitate the work of the Tropical Ecology 
Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network. The [TEAM 
Network](http://www.teamnetwork.org/) is a global network of sites in tropical 
forests focused on collecting standardized real-time data measuring 
the response of tropical forests to changing climate, land cover and land use, 
and population.

`teamr` is designed to facilitate the processing and analysis of TEAM data and 
remote sensing imagery of TEAM sites for measuring change in ecosystems from 
the plot-landscape scales.

The toolkit is still under active development. Follow the [TEAM 
website](http://www.teamnetwork.org/) for news, and the [toolkit project page
on github](https://github.com/azvoleff/teamr) for the latest version of the 
code.

## Package Installation

### Step one - install GDAL

*NOTE*: this step is only required if you want to use the `unstack_ledapscdr` 
function in `teamr`. All the other functions in `teamr` will work without 
installing GDAL.

#### Windows:

Download the [32bit](http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86.exe) 
or [64bit](http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86_64.exe) [OSGeo4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) installer.

Run the installer. Choose the "Express Desktop Install".  On the "Select 
Packages" screen, ensure the GDAL screen package is checked. You can uncheck 
the boxes for QGIS and GRASS GIS if you don't want them installed (though I 
highly recommend QGIS).

[Edit your environment variables](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310519):

1. Add "C:\OSGeo4W\bin" (or "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin" if you installed the 64bit 
version) to the "PATH" environment variable.
2. Add a new "GDAL_DATA" environment variable equal to "C:\OSGeo4W\share\gdal" 
(or "C:\OSGeo4W64\share\gdal" for the 64bit version).

#### Linux (ubuntu):

At a shell prompt, type:

``` sh
sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
```

### Step two - install the `teamr` package in R
As `teamr` is still under development, it is not yet listed on 
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org).  The easiest way to install the (beta 
version) of the `teamr` package is using the 
[devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package 
from Hadley Wickham. After installing `devtools` from CRAN, type:

```R
install_github('teamr', username='azvoleff')
```

at the R prompt to install `teamr`.

If you are installing on Windows, you will first need to install the 
appropriate version of [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) 
for your version of R (as `teamr` contains C++ code).
