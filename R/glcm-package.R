#' Calculate textures from grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs) in R
#'
#' Enables calculation of image textures derived from grey-level co-occurrence 
#' matrics (GLCMs) in R. The texture calculation is coded in C++ to optimize 
#' computation time.

#' calculate GLCM textures in EXELIS ENVI from the \code{glcm_test_raster} 
#' included in the \code{glcm} package. The following settings were used:

#' levels 32; textures to compute: mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, 
#' dissimilarity, entropy, second moment, correlation.
